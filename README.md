# 👋 Hey, how is it going?

Name is Yuiry - a software engineer focused on building **self-hosted AI systems** — local LLMs, AI agents, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines.

Right now, my work is centered on:
- 🤖 **LLM agents with tool use**
- 📁 **RAG apps with self-hosted models**
- 🧠 **Autonomous reasoning systems** using local infrastructure

---

## 🧪 Featured Projects

- 🔌 [**Yvo Bot Backend**](https://github.com/phoenyx08/yvo-bot-backend)  
  Local AI assistant using Ollama, command routing, and dynamic tool invocation.

- 🧠 [**Airwindows Expert**](https://github.com/phoenyx08/airwindows-expert)  
  RAG-based chatbot with FAISS-powered document search, grounding on Ollama + LangChain-style stack.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

**Core Tools:**  
Ollama • FAISS • LangChain • Python • FastAPI • Docker • Git

**AI Focus Areas:**  
- 🧠 Local LLMs (LLaMA, Mistral, Code Llama)
- 🛠️ Tool use (commands, context switching, file operations)
- 📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (custom datasets)
- 🧩 Agent workflows (planning, chaining, decision logic)

---

## 🔧 Background

- 💼 Not long ago PHP backend developer (Symfony, REST APIs, microservices)
- 🔄 Transitioning into **AI engineering** — bringing experience from backend design into intelligent systems
- 🧱 Strong grounding in system design, data flow, and integration

---

## 🚀 Current Focus

- Expanding agent frameworks using local LLMs + toolchains  
- Testing open-source inference backends (llama.cpp, vLLM, Ollama)  
- Experimenting with LangGraph, CrewAI, and advanced orchestration

---

## 📫 Let's Collaborate

- 🧠 Open to AI agent prototyping, OSS collaboration, or early-stage AI startups
- 📬 Reach me via GitHub or Upwork
